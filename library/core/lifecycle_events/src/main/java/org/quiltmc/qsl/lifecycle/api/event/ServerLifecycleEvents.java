	 *
	 * <ul>
	 * <li><b>integrated server:</b> the client will continue to tick after this event is executed. If the client is being
	 * shut down, then this event is called after events indicating the client is being shut down are called.
	 * <li><b>dedicated server:</b> this will be the last event called before the Java Virtual Machine terminates.

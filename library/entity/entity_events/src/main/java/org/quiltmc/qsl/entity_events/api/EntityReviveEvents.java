/**
 * A pair of callbacks which are invoked when a LivingEntity takes fatal damage.
 *
 * <p>Mods can return true from a callback to keep the entity alive, like totems of undying do. This will also prevent
 * {@link LivingEntityDeathCallback} listeners from being called.
 *
 * <p>Vanilla checks for entity health {@code <= 0} each tick (with
 * {@link net.minecraft.entity.LivingEntity#isDead()}), and kills the entity if this is true - so the entity will
 * still die next tick if this event is cancelled. It's assumed that the listener will do something to prevent this,
 * for example:
 *
 * <ul>
 *     <li>a totem-of-undying mod giving the player a little health + regeneration effect</li>
 *     <li>a minigame mod teleporting the player into a 'respawn room' and setting their health to 20.0</li>
 *     <li>a mod that changes death mechanics switching the player over to the mod's play-mode, where death doesn't
 *     apply</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>These events are short-circuiting - if the entity has already been revived, your callback will not fire.
